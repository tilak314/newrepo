GIT:
->it is a version control system.It records the changes made by our code 
our time in database called repository
->we can look at our project history and can see who has made much changes
when and why
->and if we screw something,we can revert back to earlier state
->without this we have constantly store our files and its copies whenevre
any change is done.This is not scalable
->specially wehn multiple people are working on same project  instead of
sending their code through email or some other thing it will be drawback.
so in a nutshell
By using of version control system
we can
->track history
->we can work together.
->it takes snapshots if our code.
->we can visit snapshots at any time.
It is of 2 types
1.centralised
all team members connnect to 1 server to get latest copy of code
ex:subversion,team foundation server
disadv:if the server goes offline we cant retrive out project
we have to wait until server comes online
2.Distributed
every team member has a own server so that we can store the code
locally on our machine
Ex:Git,mercurial.
Git is the msot popular.
bcz it is free,open source,super fast,scalable
Using Git:
1.using cmd line
2.code editors and ides(Vs code etc)
3.GUI(it has some limitations,and it is not always available)
There are 3 
1.system->all users
2.global->all repositories of current user
3.local->the current repository


Some imp commands:

->git config --global user.name "tilak314"   --->sets user name to that
similarly for mailid also.
git config --global -e
->opens the file in which all our details are present in our default editor(vs code)
code
->opens vs code
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
->tells the cmd prompt to wait until we close the new vs code instance.
git config -h
->gives the extra info about git config command.
git init
->initialise the git repo
git add<file>
->add files to index
git add .
->add all files
git add *.html
->adds all html files
git status
->check status of working tree
git commit
->commit changes in index
git push
->push to remote repo
git pull
->pull latest from remote repo
git clone
->copy repo into new directory
